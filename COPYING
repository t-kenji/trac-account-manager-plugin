The previous, informal "license", that has been more of a statement rather than
a real license in legal sense, is reproduced below as well:

"THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
<trac@matt-good.net> wrote this file.  As long as you retain this notice you
can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.   Matthew Good

exclusively for acct_mgr/md5crypt.py:

Based on FreeBSD src/lib/libcrypt/crypt.c 1.2
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/src/lib/libcrypt/crypt.c?rev=1.2&content-type=text/plain

Original license:
"THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
<phk@login.dknet.dk> wrote this file.  As long as you retain this notice you
can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.   Poul-Henning Kamp

This port adds no further stipulations.  I forfeit any copyright interest.
